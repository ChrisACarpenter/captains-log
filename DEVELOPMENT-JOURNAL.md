Append-only log of decisions, progress, and open questions. Most recent entries at the bottom.

## 2026-06-18 — Project kickoff

Started the planning conversation. Captured the problem statement, feature wishlist, and architectural direction.

### Decisions made

- **Project name:** Captain's Log
- **Location:** `/Users/chris.carpenter/PROJECTS/Prodigy/CaptainsLog/`
- **Tech stack direction:** Tauri 2.0, cross-platform from day one (Mac first), web frontend
- **Storage:** Plain markdown on disk
- **File organization:** `journals/YYYY/YYYY-Www.md` — year folders, one file per ISO week
- **Metadata:** `journals/.metadata/labels.json`, `journals/.metadata/settings.json`
- **Sync:** Local-only for v1. Abstract the storage layer so Google Drive sync can plug in later. Encryption can layer on top of either backend.
- **Vocabulary:** "Note" = single timestamped entry, "Weekly Notes" = section that holds them, "Weekly Summary" = optional 4-field structured summary using the Lattice template
- **Quick capture:** Menu bar icon, 2-click flow (open → submit)
- **Icons:** Menu bar (quick capture) AND dock (opens full journal window)
- **Label model:** Two input paths feeding one index
  - Dedicated Labels field (JIRA-style autocomplete, never asks user to type `#`)
  - Inline `#hashtags` in body text (also autocomplete-aware)
  - Both contribute to the file's frontmatter aggregate and to `labels.json`
  - Self-cleans when usage drops to zero
- **First-run setup:** Name, journal storage location, reminder preference (and time if on)
- **Weekly reminder notifications:** Optional, user-configurable day and time
- **Performance Review module:** Phase 5 — bundles a date range of Notes + Summaries into a single markdown file plus instructions for an LLM. Assumes MCP connectors are available for link enrichment (Jira, GitHub, Slack, Confluence).

### Why these decisions

- **Tauri over Electron:** ~5MB vs ~150MB bundle, uses native WebKit on macOS, smaller memory footprint, modern choice in 2026.
- **Year-based file organization:** Universal mental model (review periods are Prodigy-specific). Date-range export works regardless of folder structure.
- **Two label input paths:** Users will hashtag naturally in prose (social media convention); they also want a dedicated field for deliberate tagging. Both flow into the same index, so UX is consistent regardless of where the user enters labels.
- **Labels on a dedicated line below the entry heading (not in frontmatter only):** Keeps the human-readable markdown readable. Labels added via the field go in `**Labels:**`; labels added via inline hashtags stay in the body. Both contribute to the file frontmatter aggregate.
- **Markdown as source of truth:** No vendor lock-in; users can edit in any external tool; the journal travels with the user; the LLM bundle export is trivial.

### Open questions / deferred

- **Brand style guide:** Prodigy has a deck (`docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cmau...`) with named colors but no extracted hex codes. Slide 4 has the actual swatches. Chris will read off the hex codes when convenient. Not blocking.
- **Font family:** Not specified in the deck. Using system defaults until we have an answer.
- **Confluence brand guide search:** Run on 2026-06-18. Only hits were 2019-2020 Design System meeting notes, all by deactivated contributors. No active brand guide exists; the deck is the most current source.
- **Web frontend framework:** TBD (React vs Svelte vs SolidJS). Decide at the start of Phase 1.
- **Markdown editor library:** TBD (CodeMirror 6 vs TipTap vs Milkdown). Decide at the start of Phase 2 work.

### Next session

- Pick a web frontend framework
- Sketch the UI for quick capture and the journal window
- Set up the Tauri project structure inside `CaptainsLog/app/`

## 2026-06-18 (later) — Scaffolding complete; framework picked; colors locked

### Done

- Folder structure created at `/Users/chris.carpenter/PROJECTS/Prodigy/CaptainsLog/`
- All planning docs written: README, ROADMAP, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT-JOURNAL, STYLE-GUIDE, and the `docs/` subfolder (data-format, label-system, file-structure, first-run-setup, ux-flows)
- `.gitignore` in place
- Git repo initialized

### Decisions made

- **Frontend framework: Svelte 5**
  - **Why:** Smaller bundle than React (good Tauri citizen), less boilerplate, reactivity model simpler than React hooks, forms-heavy nature of this app plays to Svelte's strengths. CodeMirror 6 works fine in Svelte.
  - **Trade-off:** Smaller ecosystem than React. Acceptable for a focused single-purpose app.
  - **Can be revisited** before any code is written if there's a strong reason.
- **Brand colors locked** — pulled from the Prodigy deck (slide 4) into [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md). Twelve colors total: primary (orange), secondary (maroon), six accents, three neutrals.
- **Theming:** App supports dark and light themes; **dark is the default**. Theme infrastructure (CSS variables) is a Phase 1 task so both themes are available early; the in-app toggle UI lands in Phase 2.

### Still open

- **Typography:** No font family identified. Using system defaults (-apple-system, SF Pro on Mac) for now.
- **Component and spacing standards:** Will codify as we design specific UI elements.
- **Editor library:** Leaning CodeMirror 6, final pick at start of Phase 2.

### Next session

- Pick a Tauri project structure (single window vs multi-window setup)
- Spin up the actual Tauri app shell inside `CaptainsLog/app/`
- Get a "Hello, Captain's Log" window appearing in dark mode using the new color tokens
