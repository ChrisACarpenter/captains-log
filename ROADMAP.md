# Captain's Log — Roadmap

## Current phase: 2 — Polish (mostly done)

Phase 1 MVP is complete. Phase 2's daily-driver polish is mostly done — first-run wizard, two-tier settings + theme toggle, label autocomplete, weekly summary UI with labels, theme v2 (Embered + Week Stripe + Noot), reminder notifications (with action buttons in production .app), Option B close flow (.Accessory + tray menu + Cmd+Q guard), production codesigning. The big remaining Phase 2 item is the journal browser (read/edit past notes). Auto-save is up next as a 3-phase polish bundle.

---

## Phase 0 — Planning & Scaffolding ✅

- [x] Project folder + docs (README, ROADMAP, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT-JOURNAL, STYLE-GUIDE, docs/*)
- [x] Tech stack locked (Tauri 2.0 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript + SvelteKit static adapter)
- [x] Brand styling pulled from RPG game (Paytone One + ABeeZee fonts, Lucide icons, 4px grid, signature drop-shadow button)
- [x] Git initialized; private repo at github.com/ChrisACarpenter/captains-log

## Phase 1 — MVP: "Can I capture a Note?" ✅

- [x] Tauri app shell that runs on macOS
- [x] Menu bar icon (Lucide book template image, macOS-native dark/light adaptive)
- [x] Quick-capture popup (one click from menu bar → one click to submit) *(dedicated popup window landed in Phase 2)*
- [x] Writes Notes into the current week's markdown file at `journals/YYYY/YYYY-Www.md`
- [x] Creates the weekly file (with empty Summary scaffold) if it doesn't exist
- [x] Basic Labels field with manual entry (no autocomplete yet)
- [x] Body text supports inline `#hashtags` as labels (basic parsing, no autocomplete yet)
- [x] All labels write to `journals/.metadata/labels.json`
- [x] First-run setup: name, journal location *(shipped in Phase 2 Option B)*
- [x] Theme infrastructure (CSS variables for dark + light; dark hardcoded for v1)

**Success criterion met:** captured multiple notes across an afternoon; markdown files contain frontmatter, Weekly Summary scaffold, Weekly Notes section, timestamped notes with labels and inline `#hashtags`.

## Phase 2 — Polish: "Can I actually use this daily?"

### Done

- [x] Dedicated quick-capture popup window (label `capture`, 460×460, hidden by default, opens via tray)
- [x] Dock icon in addition to menu bar — both shipped
- [x] First-run wizard (4 steps: welcome → name → location → reminder)
- [x] Two-tier settings — app-level (`~/Library/Application Support/.../app-settings.json`) + journal-level (`<root>/.metadata/settings.json`)
- [x] Folder picker via `tauri-plugin-dialog`
- [x] Optional weekly reminder notification (real macOS notifications via `tauri-plugin-notification`)
- [x] In-process scheduler restart on settings save (no double-restart needed)
- [x] RPG petbook icon as the app icon (Dock, Finder, Cmd+Tab)
- [x] RPG scroll icon as the reminder notification icon
- [x] Settings panel — `/settings` route, full form (name, location, reminder, theme), all changes apply in-process
- [x] Light/dark theme toggle in Settings (live preview, persisted in app-settings.json)
- [x] Label autocomplete (chip-based JIRA-style dropdown with per-label color from accent palette, fed by `labels.json`)
- [x] `labels.json` schema normalized to camelCase (snake_case alias kept for backwards compat)
- [x] Weekly Summary UI (the 4-field Lattice template at `/summary`)
- [x] Hot-swap `LocalFilesystem` when journal_root changes — settings panel changes apply in-process, no app restart needed
- [x] **Theme v2 — Embered + Week Stripe.** Both themes overhauled after a 6-lens adversarial critique. Warm-tinted neutrals across both modes; split border tokens (decorative orange vs structural neutral); tokenized previously-hardcoded values (focus glow, sapphire bg, marble colors); WCAG 2.2 contrast fixes on light focus ring + text-muted; new `--bg-code` surface for Phase 2 markdown editor.
- [x] **Week Stripe** at the top of the main window — a 4px Prodigy-orange progress meter (track + fill) that grows across the week. Earns its position by being load-bearing on day 1, not decorative chrome.
- [x] **Noot reminder marker** — when a weekly reminder is set, a small Noot mascot hangs on the stripe at the reminder day/time position. (`npc-noot-small` extracted from `ui-login-credentials` atlas.)
- [x] **Wizard guide hand** — rotated `pointer-hand-straight` sprite (from `ui-guide-hands`) bobs gently next to the active input on first-run setup steps.
- [x] **Weekly Summary labels field** — new `### Labels` subsection in the markdown, chip-based LabelInput on the form, full parse/render/replace pipeline + 3 new tests.
- [x] **Settings-changed event broadcast** — `update_settings` and `complete_first_run` now emit a Tauri event so the capture popup re-applies the new theme without restart, and the week stripe makes Noot appear/disappear immediately after a reminder toggle.
- [x] **Window state persistence (`tauri-plugin-window-state`)** — both windows remember size + position across launches. `VISIBLE` flag dropped from defaults so the capture popup respects `visible: false` on launch.
- [x] **macOS notifications via `UNUserNotificationCenter`** — migrated from the deprecated `NSUserNotification` (`mac-notification-sys`) to the modern API (`mac-usernotifications`). Hybrid path: production `.app` → UN with action buttons + permission prompt + persistence; `tauri dev` bare binary → legacy fallback (no crash, no buttons, but functional for testing the wiring).
- [x] **Production .app codesigning** — `bundle.macOS.signingIdentity = "-"` in tauri.conf.json so Tauri's bundler runs a real `codesign --force --sign - --identifier com.prodigygame.captainslog` pass. Required for `usernotificationsd` to accept the UN auth request (it keys permission off the codesign Identifier, not CFBundleIdentifier).
- [x] **Persistent Alert Style hint** — settings page explains that macOS defaults new apps to "Temporary" notifications (auto-dismiss, hide action buttons) and provides a one-click deep link to the Captain's Log notification preference panel via `x-apple.systempreferences:`.
- [x] **Close flow — Option B** (`.Accessory` activation policy). Red X on main hides + flips to `.Accessory` (Dock icon hides, tray persists). Tray right-click menu with **Show Captain's Log** / **Quit Captain's Log**. Custom macOS app menu (with Cmd+Q routed through our handler, not the predefined Quit that bypasses it). Cross-window `DirtyRegistry` + native NSAlert prompt at quit time if any surface has unsaved work.

- [x] **Auto-save Phase 1** — Weekly Summary debounced auto-save (1.5s after typing stops). Status indicator beside the Save button: `Saving…` / `Saved HH:MM` / `Unsaved changes` / `Couldn't save — retry?`. Manual Save still works as force-immediate. After auto-save, summary leaves the dirty registry.
- [x] **Auto-save Phase 2** — Capture popup draft persistence. Drafts at `<journal>/.metadata/capture-draft.json`; load on mount, debounced save on change, clear on Submit. `Draft saved HH:MM` indicator below the actions row. New `delete_metadata` trait method on `StorageBackend`. Also adds a Ruby **Discard** button with native confirmation that cancels pending saves, deletes the draft, and hides the popup.
- [x] **Auto-save Phase 3** — Stripped the red-X prompts. Red X now hides main + capture silently (no dialog). Cmd+Q / tray Quit still uses the unsaved-work guard as a backstop for the rare debounce-gap case.

### Remaining

- [ ] Full journal window with year/week tree sidebar (the big one)
- [ ] Open and edit past Notes (depends on browser)
- [ ] Markdown editor with rich text rendering (CodeMirror 6 or similar)
- [ ] Inline `#` autocomplete in body text (could reuse the LabelInput dropdown logic)
- [ ] macOS system spell-check on inputs (largely default; verify on the new textareas)

**Success:** Captain's Log has replaced any other journaling system I was using.

## Phase 3 — Search & Navigation

- [ ] Full-text search across all weekly files
- [ ] Filter by label, date range, file
- [ ] Click search result → opens correct week, scrolls to correct Note
- [ ] Year/week tree handles many years gracefully

## Phase 4 — Link Enrichment

- [ ] Detect URLs in Notes (Jira, GitHub, Slack, Confluence to start)
- [ ] Fetch metadata via MCP connectors
- [ ] Store enriched metadata inline or in a `.metadata/links/` cache
- [ ] Display enriched cards in the rendered view (status, title, last update)
- [ ] Room to grow to other systems beyond the initial four

## Phase 5 — Performance Review Module

The reason this app exists.

- [ ] Date range picker (calendar UI)
- [ ] "Bundle this range as a single markdown file" export
- [ ] Bundle includes Notes + Summaries + enriched link metadata
- [ ] Bundle prepends a configurable instruction block for the LLM
- [ ] Configurable review-question templates (e.g. the 8-question Prodigy mid-year template)
- [ ] One-click "draft my review" flow that produces editable first-draft answers

## Phase 6 — Sync & Sharing

- [ ] Google Drive sync option (everyone at Prodigy has a Google account)
- [ ] Conflict resolution for multi-device edits
- [ ] At-rest encryption (so synced files aren't readable without the app)

## Phase 7 — Cross-Platform

- [ ] Validated Windows build
- [ ] Validated Linux build
- [ ] CI for all three platforms

---

## Deferred / TBD

- [ ] **Higher-resolution petbook source** — current app icon is upscaled from a 96×96 source PNG. Larger sizes (256/512/1024) are softer than they could be. Replace `src-tauri/icons/source-petbook.png` and re-run `npx @tauri-apps/cli icon …` if a higher-res asset surfaces.
- [ ] **Spacing, motion, and component library finalization** — colors, typography, iconography, and core component patterns are locked in [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md). Still TBD: final spacing scale tokens, animation/transition spec, complete reusable component spec library. Address as we build screens in Phase 2.
- [ ] **Bulk label management UI** — rename/merge/delete labels across all files. Phase 2 if it becomes a pain point; later if not.
- [ ] **Plugin / extension API** — let other tools read/write Captain's Log data.
- [ ] **iOS/Android companion app** — flagged but probably not worth doing soon.
- [ ] **Multi-user / team features** — flagged but likely never.
